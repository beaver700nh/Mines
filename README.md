# Mines (Work in Progress)
This is a relatively simple minesweeper game written in Python using Tkinter.<br/>
As of this writing, the game works on at least Raspbian 9 and Windows 10.

# TODO:
* Use rowspan, columnspan options to make grid() look nice
* Use sticky option for anchoring, N+E+W+S for center
